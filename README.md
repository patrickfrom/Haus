I'm currently trying to learn Vulkan, It's quite fun and challenging. Progress is being made and I've managed to render 2 Spheres with Moon Texture.

I decided to create a dev branch where It's like a fresh start so I can abstract, 
but I'll slowly go through the steps to render a clear color and then after that do some 3D Rendering!
